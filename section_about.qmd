Since this site's *raison d'être* is professional, I should say a word or two about me *qua* wage laborer


According to my résumé, I'm a political science PhD candidate at SUNY Stony Brook. In my actual day-to-day, however, I spend most of my time "upskilling" in technical AI safety and AI governance/policy. To that end, I ...

* facilitate a couple groups of CAIS's [AI Safety, Ethics, and Society course](https://www.aisafetybook.com/virtual-course)
* am a frequent presenter at and triumvir of BlueDot Impact's unofficial Evals Paper Reading club (see here for BlueDot Impact's [calendar](https://lu.ma/aisafetycommunityevents))
* (somewhat) recently [completed](https://course.bluedot.org/certification?id=rec9yoVWhpX6wsDiY) the [BlueDot AI Governance](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/governance/) course
* am currently taking Vista's [National Security Law and AI Course](https://vistainstituteai.org/programs/national-security-law-ai)

I'm also an active member of the Effective Altruism community -- I attended my first Effective Altruism Global(x) event in Mexico City in March of 2025.

Looking back to the recent past, during my time at Stony Brook I had the pleasure of taking courses with such luminaries as [Stanley Feldman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Feldman_(political_scientist)), [Andy Delton](https://sites.google.com/site/andrewdeltonpubs/), and [Yanna Krupnikov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanna_Krupnikov). The dissertation I'm currently wrapping up under the guidance of [Michael Peress](http://www.michaelperess.com/) consists of three mostly independent chapters, covering immigration opinion's effect on immigration policymaking at the level of US states, cross-national comparisons of the urban-rural divide across the globe, and an intranational study of urban-rural movements and ideological shifts in the Netherlands.

Before landing on the Ye Longe Isle of Bagels & Hockey Fanatics, I taught English for a few years in Ecuador and Peru. And before that, I triple majored in philosophy, psychology, and German at the University of Arkansas (with a year spent at Karl-Franzens Universität in Graz, Austria).
