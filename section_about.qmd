Since this site's *raison d'être* is professional, I should say a word or two about myself *qua* wage laborer

According to my résumé, I'm a political science PhD candidate at SUNY Stony Brook. In my actual day-to-day, however, I spend most of my time "upskilling" in technical AI safety and AI governance/policy. To that end, I ...

- am lead organizer of BlueDot Impact's Evals Group (see here for BlueDot Impact's [calendar](https://lu.ma/aisafetycommunityevents))
- facilitate a couple groups of CAIS's [AI Safety, Ethics, and Society course](https://www.aisafetybook.com/virtual-course)
- also facilitate for European Network for AI Safety's "[Deep Dive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FbbhWto1zrlCXyGjNQ_kd4l7sgsuMz053EXfL1ODfkg/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.v9heqvs05mt2)" AI Policy Course

- less recently [completed](https://course.bluedot.org/certification?id=rec9yoVWhpX6wsDiY) the [BlueDot AI Governance](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/governance/) course

I'm also an active member of the Effective Altruism community -- I attended my first Effective Altruism Global(x) event in Mexico City in March of 2025.

Looking back to the recent past, during my time at Stony Brook I had the pleasure of taking courses with such luminaries as [Stanley Feldman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Feldman_(political_scientist)), [Andy Delton](https://sites.google.com/site/andrewdeltonpubs/), and [Yanna Krupnikov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanna_Krupnikov). The dissertation I'm currently wrapping up under the guidance of [Michael Peress](http://www.michaelperess.com/) consists of three mostly independent chapters, one documenting public opinion on immigration's effect on immigration policymaking at the level of US states, a second chapter covering cross-national comparisons of the urban-rural divide, and the third analyzing urban-rural moves and ideological shifts in the Netherlands.

Before starting my PhD, I taught English for a few years in Ecuador and Peru. And before that, I triple majored in philosophy, psychology, and German at the University of Arkansas (with a year spent at Karl-Franzens Universität in Graz, Austria).
