title: "About Me"
---

Since this site's *raison d'être* is professional, I should say a word or two about me *qua* wage laborer. 

According to my résumé, I'm an ABD^["All but dissertation," where "all" refers to the sum of the non-dissertation PhD requirements. This designation means that the only remaining task separating my current plebian instantiation from my "Doctor Dollman" self is a dissertation defense] PhD candidate in political science at SUNY Stony Brook. In my actual day-to-day, however, I spent most of my time "upskilling" in AI governance/policy and technical AI safety, two incredibly interesting (and hopefully impactful) areas into which I'm trying to transition. In pursuit of that transition, I recently completed the [BlueDot AI Governance](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/governance/) course and I'm an active member of the Effective Altruism community -- I attended my first Effective Altruism Global(x) event in Mexico City in March of 2025. 

During my time at Stony Brook I had the pleasure of taking courses with such luminaries as [Stanley Feldman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Feldman_(political_scientist)), [Andy Delton](https://sites.google.com/site/andrewdeltonpubs/), and [Yanna Krupnikov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanna_Krupnikov). The dissertation I'm currently wrapping up under the guidance of [Michael Peress](http://www.michaelperess.com/) consists of three mostly independent chapters, covering immigration opinion's effect on immigration policymaking at the level of US states, cross-national comparisons of the urban-rural divide across the globe, and an intranational study of urban-rural movements and ideological shifts in the Netherlands. These topics represent my _circa_ 2019 interests preserved in amber, with the aforementioned artificial intelligence areas currently occupying my mental life.

Before landing on the Ye Longe Isle of Bagels & Hockey Fanatics, I taught English for a few years in Ecuador and Peru. And before that, I triple majored in philosophy, psychology, and German at the University of Arkansas (with a year spent at Karl-Franzens Universität in Graz, Austria).
