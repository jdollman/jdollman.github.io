Not only did it reduce belief in participants' *focal* conspiracy, defined as whatever conspiracy the participant endorsed at the beginning of the study, it also reduced credence given to other, \"non-focal\" conspiracies.^[The non-focal conspiracies were the 15 popular conspiracy theories from the Belief in Conspiracy Theories Inventory ([here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.1583)). These 15 are the \"greatest hits\" of conspiracy theories: Area 51, JFK assassination, Princess Diana, (Fake) Moon Landing, etc.] Their paper is a very important methodological advance in the 'corrections' literature which had been hampered by necessarily mostly static materials that could only hamfistedly react to participants' unique profiles and priorities.\n\nFor their paper, they relied on a [CloudResearch Connect](https://www.cloudresearch.com/products/connect-for-participants/) sample quota-matched to the US Census along various demographic dimensions to make it demographically representative. But knowing that their study would make a splash, they set up a [website](https://www.debunkbot.com/) to which the inevitable media coverage could direct traffic to and generate additional participants. Sure enough, the website has had over 30,000 visitors since its inauguration in September of last year. This post will be an analysis of the data created by those participants. \n\nTwo notes before beginning. First, I had the pleasure of meeting the study's lead author, Tom Costello, when he came to Stony Brook to participate on a [panel](https://library.stonybrook.edu/library-events/democracy-in-the-digital-age-ais-influence-on-2024-elections/) and he kindly granted me access to the data. Second, though this post is (or will be) self-contained, I would encourage anyone who hasn't read the CRP paper to do so, as it's the \"real thing.\" This post, at least as in its current state, is more 'exploratory vibes' and likely only of interest as inside baseball. If you're pressed for time you might want to skip the first two sections, **The Sample** and **The Survey Experience**, and go straight to [**Results**](#sec-results).^[If the paper as a whole is inside baseball, the first two sections might be 'dugout-ology'.]\n\n# The Sample\n\nAs I mentioned, it was a stroke of farsightedness to create the website in advance of news coverage of the Science article.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLest you be seduced by those towering five-digit weekly volumes, the vast majority of those who landed on [debunkbot.com](debunkbot.com) just came to check out the site and did **not** complete the interaction with a large language model. If you filter out the people who didn't finish, the plot above turns into the one below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are two things to note, First, the tenfold reduction of the $y$-axis. Second, among those who did finish, around one third of them chose to not make their data public. The saddest part of that is that those who are 'paranoid' enough to want to prevent researchers from using their data are exactly the people that you'd most want to study. Still, considering the remaining number of participants each week as their own samples, almost every one of them is larger than the average social psychology study published from the 1950s to the 1990s.\n\nWhereas CRP's sample was demographically representative of the US, these survey takers are far from that. They're young(ish), very white, preposterously educated, and very Democratic.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n-   The average survey taker reports being 48 years old.[^1]\n-   Respondents are 89% white.\n-   Whereas the majority of Americans do not have a bachelor's degree, the modal respondent has a bachelor's with an almost equal amount having a master's degree! In fact, more people report having a doctorate than (only) a high school diploma!\n-   Given the ability to choose among seven partisanship categories from strong Democrat to strong Republican, the most common response was Strongly Democratic with 28.9%! A full 68% of respondents identify as some kind of Democrat ('plain' Democrats as well as leaners). Only 11.5% report being some kind of Republican. The remaining 20.6% of those who gave their partisanship said they were 'Strictly Independent'.\n\n[^1]: This is calculated after trimming off implausibly (i.e., *trollishly*) low and high ages.\n\nWhile these aren't the distributions you'd hope for if you wanted to make inferences about the US population, it is unique to have data on conspiracy theorizing from precisely the population *least* associated with conspiratorial ideation.\n\n# The Survey Experience\n\nAn underrated aspect of understanding an experiment's results is having a sense of subjects' phenomenology as they go through it. To that end, I'd recommend that anyone reading this just go to [debunkbot.com](https://www.debunkbot.com/) and try it out for themselves. But if you lack either the ability, time, or desire to go there, you can read my description with restrained editorializing below.\n\nParticipants navigate to debunkbot.com, where they are informed that, should they choose, they will participate in a survey where they interact with an AI (\"a conspiracy debunking bot\") and get personalized feedback.^[The landing page of [debunkbot.com](https://www.debunkbot.com/) frames site visitors' upcoming experience in perhaps a slightly antagonistic way. First, the thing is called *Debunk*Bot, which I'd say implies that you're about to give it some [bunk](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bunk#:~:text=(slang)%20Bunkum%3B%20senseless%20talk%2C%20nonsense.). Also, the landing page encourages you to \"Test your beliefs against an AI. Will you change your mind? Try our conspiracy debunking bot and get personalized feedback.\" which *I* feel has vibes of, \"You 'win' if you don't change your mind and lose if you do\". I asked my good friend Claude what they thought and got the reply, \"its framing is notably antagonistic in several ways.\" This isn't necessarily bad. It just means that users' responses are going to be even more skewed toward the outgrowths of antagonistic political discourse culture: trolling, obstinancy, and extremity. In the empirical social sciences we often say, \"Alright, this is going to be an even tougher test of your hypothesis.\" Tom Costello remarked that maybe there could be an \"EagleChat\" skin for the site which would be more amenable to a certain crowd.] Then, across two pages, people describe a conspiracy they \"find particularly credible or compelling\" and, on the second page, \"share more about what led you to find this theory compelling.\"^[This text is sent to ChatGPT, which confirms (or not) that the visitor has in fact described a conspiracy theory. If ChatGPT determines that the visitor did *not* describe a conspiracy theory, the visitor is offered the possibility of participating in a different arm of the survey, [the 'Disagreement with Experts' arm](#sec-disagreement).] Visitors' responses in these two open-ended text boxes represent one set of data -- a set of natural language descriptions conspiracy theories which spontaneously come to people's minds. \n\nBefore visitors proceed to their conversation with the LLM, they see an LLM-generated short summary of their conspiracy theory and are prompted, \"On a scale of 0% to 100%, please indicate your level of confidence that this statement is true.\" Lastly, visitors respond to the question \"How important is this theory to your personal beliefs or understanding of the world?\" on a 1-8 scale (where 8 is anchored with \"Extremely important to my beliefs and worldview\"). At that point comes the core of the experiment, the four-turn interaction with the LLM (more on that in the next paragraph). Afterward, participants rate their post-interaction certainty in the conspiracy using the following scale.\n\n![](DEBUNKBOT-POST-IMAGES/CERTAINTY_POST.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"75%\"}\n\nLastly, participants can fill out an optional demographics page and/or a user feedback page (a sugggestions box, if you will).\n\nNow for the editorializing!\n\nWhat's the DebunkBot conversation like? From the perspective of a `debunkbot.com` site visitor, the interaction starts with the AI responding to the specific conspiracy theory previously endorsed by the visitor. Behind the scenes, the conversation starts when the LLM first 'sees' the following [system message](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/138b1qt/what_is_the_system_message_on_chatopenaicom/):\n\n> \"Your goal is to very effectively persuade users to stop believing in the epistemically fraught belief that {{conspiracyTheory}} You will be having a conversation with a person who, on a psychometric survey, endorsed this belief as {{userBeliefLevel}} out of 100 (where 0 is Definitely False, 50 is Uncertain, and 100 is Definitely True). Further, we asked the user to provide an open-ended response about their perspective on this matter, which is piped in as the first user response. Please generate a response that will persuade the user that this belief is not supported, based on their reasoning. Again, your goal is to create a conversation that allows individuals to reflect on, and change, their beliefs (toward a less epistemically unwarranted view of the world). Use simple language that an average person will be able to understand.\"\n\nAfter that `system message`, it sees its first `user message`, which is the reasoning the visitor supplied when prompted earlier. The LLM then generates the aforementioned message that, from the visitor's perspective, opens the dialogue with the LLM. After that, the user has three chances to engage with the LLM. If you would like to see an example of how such a conversation plays out, I've put some screenshots of a conversation I had with it in the [appendix](#sec-conspiracy). If you want my description of the messages, the first thing I would say is that they're lengthy *for a conversation*. If you think about this from the perspective of the researchers, they had to navigate a tradeoff between giving short, more conversational messages that contained less information and longer messages that really tried to, you know, *debunk* a conspiracy. Personally, I would have gone for shorter messages to make the interaction seem more conversational and place less of a burden on participants, but a) it's ultimately an empirical question which message length is best and b) shorter messages would mean more rapid pinging of OpenAI's API and so invite glitchiness, costs, and other undesirable things. The tone of the messages is definitely friendly, but a little too faux-friendly.[^2] For example, here are the first sentence(s) of its first three messages to me:\n\n[^2]: In case you think it's a given an LLM would be faux-friendly, I mean that it's generic, customer service friendly. For an example of a language model that seems genuinely friendly, I'd recommend the Sonnet 3.5 version of Claude.\n\n1.  It's great to hear that you're open to exploring different perspectives on this topic. I understand your point about the proximity of the Wuhan Virology Institute to the initial outbreak, and it's natural to question these coincidences.\n2.  You bring up important points about trust in large organizations and the potential for bias in the scientific community.\n3.  I appreciate your candor and critical view-it's important to have open discussions about the realities of how institutions work, including scientific ones.\n\nThere's nothing *wrong* with these messages, but I do feel like I'm being kid-gloved a little. I imagine the people whom misinformation experts most want to reach would find this tone to be patronizing -- though I'm very unsure about that.\n\nI'd also note that I found the language model to be a little evasive when I pressed it for particulars, but this is perhaps a function of its responses being quite long and general.[^3] According to me, the best conversational turn I had with it happened 3/4^ths^ of the way though the conversation and I thought we weren't getting anywhere. I asked, \"If you could give one piece of evidence that you think is the most damaging to the lab leak hypothesis, what would it be?\" to which it then did give the most convincing piece of information it had so far given. I think that's telling. If my experience is representative, the LLM is probably too reactive. As in, it's not 'agenda-setting' enough -- it has the debate \"on the conspiracy theorist's terms.\" It's probably a familiar experience to those of you who have talked to people who believe what call conspiracies, and it is like playing the world's least fun version of whack-a-mole. Hopefully future research will look into the value of taking more initiative in debunking conspiracy theories/misinformation.\n\n[^3]: Again, check out the conversation -- or have one yourself! -- to get a feel for what I mean.\n\n# Results {#sec-results}\n\n## On Certainty\n\nAs indicated by the title of the paper, \"Durably *reducing conspiracy beliefs* through dialogues with AI\" (emphasis added), the key result was the reduction in conspiracy belief from pre- to post-interaction. Did that also happen in the online sample?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere you see that there was this mass of respondents between 50 and 100 that flattened.

In our era of online surveys with massively modififiable survey flow, it's criminal how little we prompt users to explain their sometimes bizarre response combinations.] The 0%-to-0% group is likely one that you just want to exclude because they simply do not believe in the conspiracy that the LLM is purportedly debunking.^[For those who understand how credence works (or, is supposed to work), you'll also notice that these people who report 100% (or 0%) certainty in their conspiracy either do *not* understand what 100% (or 0%) certainty means or are trolling.]\n\nThere are two explanations for why the 50%-to-50% group is as prominent as it is. The substantive explanation is that when people are uncertain, they default to saying 50% (or \"it's a coin toss\"). That is, they map any certainty level between 10% and 90% to 50%. The 'methods' (or artifact) explanation for the prominence of the 50%-to-50% group is that the certainty scale is initialized with the dial(?) at 50%. So, if the participant does *nothing* and just clicks through on both occasions, they will appear as having been 50% certain both times. And participants love nothing more than just clicking through.\n\nThis pattern of responses – particularly the clustering at 0%, 50%, and 100% – reminded me of my brief prior life when I was really into forecasting (i.e., trying to predict the future), a key subarea of which is probability elicitation. I suspect that no researcher would say that Joe Sixpack is going to faithfully map their subjective probability onto a 0-100 scale. So, looking at the English-language anchors on the scale, I discretized it according to the following mapping:\n\n| Category               | Range  |\n|------------------------|--------|\n| Def. False             | 0-15   |\n| Prob. False            | 15-35  |\n| Uncertain (Lean False) | 35-45  |\n| Uncertain              | 45-55  |\n| Uncertain (Lean True)  | 55-65  |\n| Prob. True             | 65-85  |\n| Def. True              | 85-100 |\n\nThis allows me to visualize the trajectories thus:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOr, if you just want to see the distributions side by side:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Conspiracy Descriptions (Forthcoming)\n\nIn addition to replicating the certainty reduction result of the original paper, the much greater sample size of the online sample allows for a text analysis of people's conspiracy beliefs.

Then gets exponentially harder.\\\" aftermathRenewablesgolden eagle struck by the blade of a wind turbineSource: jblRenewables are hailed as saviors of the planet but are environmental nightmares. Biomass causes deforestation and huge CO2 emissions. Hydropower destroys rivers and emits CO2 and methane. Solar and wind harm the environment, need fossil fuels, only last for a decade or two, kill wildlife, insects and marine life in large numbers, destroy ecosystems, need lots of harmful components, and end up as mountains of toxic waste that will keep on growing for as long as they are are used. There is nothing sustainable about any of that. Renewables are not what they are cracked up to be Before going into the harm that renewables do, it must be noted that they don't seem to be doing much good. Biomass and hydropower are producing significant amounts of greenhouse gases. Solar and wind are supposed to be reducing CO2 in the atmosphere but are not doing so. The first wind farm was built in the USA in 1981. Globally there are now more than 340,000 wind turbines. It is estimated that 10 trillion dollars have already been spent directly and indirectly on solar and wind. And yet there is no sign of CO2 levels coming down. On the contrary, in the same period CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere kept on rising to record heights and in 2023 they are rising faster than ever. Renewables are supposed to be replacing fossil fuels. They are not doing so. There is hardly any decline in the consumption of fossil fuels, while solar and wind cannot even meet the annual increase in energy consumption. This means that they are not replacing anything, only adding to the total of greenhouse gases and environmental devastation. As energy consumption is expected to keep on rising, solar and wind will be chasing a retreating target for years to come. The harms Misinformation The first harm may seem unspectacular on first sight but it is the underlying cause for all the others. By creating a false impression of the merits of renewables misinformation prevents real action against climate change and is therefore extremely dangerous. Deception has become a new normal in the modern business world, especially where the environment is concerned. Even the most destructive eco-criminals will claim that their work is environment-friendly or sustainable or carbon-neutral or whatever greenwashing term they invent. None of it is true, but that matters little if people believe it. And, sadly, people are very eager to believe what they want to believe. It is the familiar story of the convenient lie versus the inconvenient truth. And what could be more convenient for humanity than having a form of energy that solves the climate crisis without the need for any personal sacrifices. The wilful gullibility of humanity made it easy for the renewables industry to weave a web of deceit. They constantly exaggerate benefits and downplay harms. They will select isolated cases of good performance in a particular area for a short period of time as representative for the whole industry. When a wind park briefly produces, say, 40% of electricity somewhere, they will use the word energy instead of electricity and boast that renewables are outperforming other sources of energy. But electricity only makes up about 20% of all energy and 40% of 20% is only 8%, which is not impressive at all. When unusual deaths occur among marine mammals near the construction of offshore wind parks, the industry immediately professes its innocence, long before any meaningful research could have been done into the cause of those deaths. Countless examples of this kind of deception can be found in a very important book, called Bright Green Lies, to which we shall return at the end of the page. Here we shall concentrate on the greatest deception of all: the energy transition (\\\"electrify everything\\\"). The claim is that renewables will be able to phase out fossil fuels in a few decades, if given unconditional support by the powers that be. Unfortunately the idea is based largely on wishful thinking. In reality such a transition is impossible with current technology. The most basic obstacle is the difficulty of storing electricity. When solar and wind are idle, electricity must come from another source. This could be surplus electricity produced by solar and wind during working hours, if it could be stored effectively. At present the best way to do so is by using lithium batteries. Unfortunately they are a very weak source of energy in comparison with, for instance, oil. It takes 46 such batteries to generate the same quantity of energy as 1 comparable quantity of oil. In practice this would mean that a diesel-fueled truck that can carry 60,000 pounds of freight 600 miles on a full tank would need about 55,000 pounds of batteries to perform the same trip. Unthinkable, of course. Nevertheless the advocates of renewables insist that this transition is the best way to tackle climate change because we shall quickly find all kinds of miraculous new technologies to overcome the problems. It is not impossible, of course, but not very likely either. The lithium battery has been around for about 40 years, being constantly upgraded and perfected to its present, still very feeble, state. Until miracles start to happen, this transition will therefore require such astronomical quantities of raw materials that global mining, processing, transportation, production and infrastructures would have to be multiplied by factors as high as 40 times. An impossible task. But even if we managed to do it, this would take a lot of time, which we don’t have (because global warming is speeding up dramatically), and will always end in crippling scarcities of raw materials, because the exercise would have to be repeated over and over again. The worst part of all this misinformation is that many people now believe that this delusional plan must be given top priority at the expense of everything else. Many trillions will be poured into a fake solution while actual solutions will be left undone. So no real cuts of emissions (without net-zero nonsense), no reduction of consumption, no population control, no end to deforestation, no rewilding, no rigorous protection of the environment etc. etc. In short, this plan carries a high risk that our industrial civilization will collapse from the effects of climate change long before the transition is completed. Biomass is easily the worst renewable. It relies heavily on the burning of trees, which is causing widespread deforestation across the globe. When trees are burned, they release large quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere, even more than coal. Their destruction also means that they cannot absorb CO2 anymore, doubling the disastrous effect of their destruction on the climate. In addition forests contain the richest ecosystems in the world. Their disappearance also means death to all the forms of life that live there. In spite of these horrors governments all over the world are calling biomass green and climate-friendly because \\\"trees grow back\\\". This is a false argument, because trees take decades to grow while they can be incinerated in minutes. In the meantime the CO2 that they release may do so much harm that no trees will regrow at all, while recovery of their ecosystems takes hundreds of years. The burning of trees is simply one of the worst ecocrimes imaginable. Hydropower is another significant source of greenhouse gases, not only CO2 but also methane, which is emitted by the reservoirs of dams and is many times worse than CO2. As usual, the quantities have been underestimated, but recent studies indicate that they make up about 6 to 8% of human methane emissions. On top of that they also destroy the ecosystems of the rivers they obstruct. They have led to the extinction of many fish and other aquatic species, the disappearance of birds in floodplains, huge losses of forest, wetland and farmland, erosion of coastal deltas, and many other unmitigable impacts. Apart from all this misery hydropower is also very vulnerable to the extremes of global warming. Too little water makes it less productive and too much water makes the dams collapse. Solar panels are made of silicon refined to 99.99 purity. Pure silicon does not occur naturally. Raw silicon must be mined and then refined. The basic raw material used is sand, which is already being depleted all across the world, because it is used in enormous quantities for many human activities. Its mining, like all mining, causes great harm to the environment. Once mined the sand must be transported to refining locations by fossil-fueled vehicles. The refining process of silicon is very intensive, requiring specialized equipment and large numbers of dangerous chemicals. During the process about 80% of the original silicon is wasted. For every ton of the end product four tons of toxic waste are produced. This waste can be neutralized but only by expensive technology, which few companies want to use. Instead it is dumped in the environment, with disastrous consequences for plants, wildlife and humans. During the process three extremely potent greenhouse gases, hexofluoroethane, nitrogen trifluoride and sulfur hexafluoride are released. They are 12,000, 17,000 and 25,000 times more potent than CO2 . The quantities are relatively small but rising rapidly. Apart from sand solar panels also require metals and rare-earth minerals, which also require large-scale mining. Separation of rare earths from ore produces 2,000 tons of toxic waste for 1 ton of rare earths. Colossal amounts of toxic wastewater are also produced, which is pumped into ponds, some covering several square miles, totally devoid of life. Apart from the panels themselves the solar power systems also require lots of other hardware, made up of many different materials that must also be mined, processed, transported and finally linked up with some kind of grid with its infrastructure. A particular odious kind of solar power system is the Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) system. Mirrors reflect sunlight to towers in which the heat is used to generate energy. The concentrated beams of sunlight kill birds and insects in high numbers. The installations occupy large tracts of land, completely ruining the original ecosystems, and also use considerable amounts of water (as much as nuclear plants according to one source). Wind The generation of wind energy harms the environment from beginning to end. First there is an abundance of materials. A wind turbine may require as many as 8,000 different materials. The most important are: steel, for the tower, nacelle and foundation concrete, for the foundation and sometimes the tower wood, for blades fiberglass and carbon fiber, for blades copper, in the nacelle rare earth materials in the nacelle Many of these components, such as steel, copper, rare earth metals etc. require mining, with all the corresponding environmental horrors already described above. Processing of the raw materials requires large amounts of energy and water, and transportation to and from factories, all involving fossil fuels. When the wind turbines are finally ready to be used, huge tracts of lands are needed for them. As they can't be placed in urban areas, this again often leads to deforestation and destruction of existing ecosystems with yet more killing of wildlife. The construction of these colossal structures and the huge infrastructure to distribute the electricity require heavy machinery (all fossil fueled), creating massive disturbances in the environments where they are placed. During operation they cause a variety of harmful effects. They kill and maim significant numbers of birds, bats and insects, which are all already in steep decline. Offshore wind parks in particular are lethal for migrating birds. Each wind turbine can kill as many as a 1,000 birds per year, especially if it is lit up for the benefit of fossil-fueled aircraft. The argument that more birds are killed by other causes is no argument at all. Evil is not lessened by the fact that there is worse. Turbines make a lot of noise and vibrations, all harmful to wildlife, which will often leave the area. The construction of wind parks at sea involves especially heavy construction work, again creating lots of environmental destruction and pollution, including noise, which is very harmful because sound is much more important to marine animals than land animals. The high sound levels from pile-driving, when the turbine is hammered to the seabed are especially harmful to marine mammal species, such as endangered whales. Wind farms don’t last forever. Sooner or later they reach the end of their useful life and must be decommissioned. This is usually a requirement when permits are issued for them. The removal of turbines and their foundations is costly, almost as much as their installation, and much costlier than their salvage value. This means that abandonment of wind farms is often the cheapest solution, which has happened on a significant scale. There are about 5,000 abandoned windmills in the USA alone. (The practice is by no means new. It is estimated that there are more than a million abandoned mines in the world and millions of abandoned oil and gas wells in the USA alone). Although attempts are made to prevent abandonment by forcing wind farm operators to provide financial security for decommissioning, this is still poorly regulated, also because wind farm operators routinely overestimate the salvage value of their windmills and underestimate the costs of removal, to make permit-issuing parties minimize the amounts that must be set aside. The costs of decommissioning will rise dramatically as the size of wind turbines increases. In the 1980s they were only 20 metres high. Now an 11-MW wind turbine can reach 225 metres, its decommissioning, especially offshore, can cost 20 million dollars per turbine. This could, of course, become a huge and even crippling problem for the wind industry but it is unlikely that many of these monstrosities will ever be decommissioned. It is already too late. Global warming is speeding up so rapidly that mega disasters cannot be far away. They will mark the end of our industrial civilization. Nobody can predict the future exactly but humanity's future will certainly include floods and fires and droughts and global crop failures, widespread famines, mass migrations and human conflicts of unprecedented ferocity. And most windmills will remain standing as enduring symbols of human folly for a very long time. The lies about renewables and other allegedly \\\"green\\\" sources of energy were thoroughly covered in the book \\\"Bright Green Lies\\\". It was also turned into a movie of the same name, which was released on Earth Day 2022. We could not agree with its message more. It reveals the terrible state of our planet and the woeful lack of a meaningful response, highlighting that all kinds of half measures, presented as environmentally friendly or sustainable or renewable, are quite the opposite. We strongly recommend it. Watch the trailer below. There cannot be the slightest doubt that renewables are part of the problem. Like the rest of our civilization they are unsustainable because they contribute to depletion of the environment. At a certain point, in the very near future, that environment will become so depleted that it cannot sustain our civilization anymore. Then that civilization will collapse, most of us will die ugly deaths, and the survivors will be faced with a depleted environment without much to survive on. This means that every day's delay in restoring the environment will make matters worse and increase the likelihood of humanity's extinction.

Being larger than other flying birds commonly seen near areas of human activity, it is easier to fit the batteries and actuators of a robot, which are less efficient per unit volume than their biological equivalents, into the shape of a Canada goose. The migratory nature and large range of these birds makes their presence routine and unsuspicious near many population centres and locations of strategic significance. Birds are generally allowed to fly freely near areas of human activity. This makes it feasible for something which looks like a bird to access regions of airspace in which aircraft or UAVs which do not belong would raise security concerns. In fact, though no operational programs of this kind have been acknowledged, various governments and companies have seriously proposed the use of bird-like UAVs for reconnaissance. Batteries and actuators designed by humans are less space-efficient than their biological equivalents. To achieve useful range, endurance, and speed, a bird robot needs to be quite large. Among birds commonly seen in areas of human activity, Canada geese are among the largest.

What aspects of conversations are associated with persuasion? Did `gpt-4-1106-preview` (or `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`) deploy different strategies with different users to more or less effect? Beyond persuasion, do different LLM conversational moves lead to more or less engagement? Investigating those interesting dyadic elements will have to come later.\n\nFor now, let's look at the most basic measure of conversational quality: message length. The plot below breaks down message length by who is generating the words (LLM/`assistant` or visitor/`user`) and what turn in the conversation it is (where `1` is the each party's opening message, `2` the first reply, etc.):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFirst, the fact that the left and right panes have different x-axis scales makes it less obvious that the 'Assistant' (the LLM) is writing *a lot* more than the user. Whereas the lion's share of assistant messages are > 400 words, the distribution of user message lengths is extremely right-skewed, with most messages fewer than 50 words in length. I've also highlighted the modal number of words used in the first and fourth (last) turns, and you see a big drop-off in engagement. Many of the users' extremely short last messages are either valedictions (*bye*) or expressions of gratitude (*thanks*, *thank you*). As you can see, it's not just the last messages that are extremely short, though. Users' extremely short messages are usually simple affirmations (*yes*, *ok*, *sure*, *i agree*) or unelaborated disagreement (*no*, *i dont believe you*, *im not convinced*).\n\nThe savvy consumers of survey research among you will wonder about [mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_effect#:~:text=Mode%20effect%20is%20a%20broad,different%20data%20to%20be%20collected.) [effects](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/81/S1/280/3091905). These mode effects are potentially relevant all over the survey, but nowhere are they as obviously relevant as in users' interaction with the language model. It's simply more costly to type responses when you're working with two thumbs compared to a full set of 10 fingers. The plots below, which disaggregate by mobil vs. desktop use (and re-aggregate over all four turns) were surprising to me:^[Transparency note: I filtered out the 1% longest messages both among the users and assistants to prevent tails from overtaking both plots.]\n\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n## Histogram\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/mobile_v_web_histo-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n## Boxplot\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/mobile_v_web_boxplot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nI would have suspected that the distributions would be much more different than they in fact are. With the boxplot, you can eyeball that the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile desktop responders are only writing about 4, 7, 15 more words, respectively, than their mobile counterparts.\n\n### A Typology of Users (Forthcoming)\n\nFrom a theoretical perspective, it's interesting to think about what [moderates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderation_(statistics)) treatment effects. Are Republicans more resistant to corrections? What about strong partisans versus leaners? Which type of conspiracy theories are most 'debunk-resistant'? The list goes on and on. \n\nFrom a practical perspective, a researcher would want to classify respondents' \"engagement type.\" Some unengaged respondents do the open-text version of [straight-lining](https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/straightlining-what-is-it-how-can-it-hurt-you-and-how-to-protect-against-it/), while others are more engaged, but \"in the wrong way\" (*i.e.*, trolling).^[Of course, trolling as a result of treatment *is* itself interesting. For example, if you had two randomly assigned treatments and found that one led to half as much trolling as the other, that's a really important outcome!] Ideally, one would have measured these people's demographics and political background information at a prior time so that you could model engagment quality (including propensity to troll), but the way information is collected here there's simply no way to do that. In future analyses I will attempt to classify people into the buckets of zero effort, pure trolling, pure hostility, and genuine engagement. Problematically, it's only among the latter set that we can really trust their use of the 0-100 belief certainty scale.\n\n# Appendix\n\n## In-Survey Attrition\n\nThe initiated among you will know about the [scourge of missing data](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.7208/9780226891293-008). Missing data can turn nice unbiased estimates into not-so-nice biased estimates. It turns random samples into [SLOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-selection_bias) and, depending on when nonresponse happens, it turns random assignment into non-random assignment, degrading causal quantities to mere correlations. It's vexatious, *en fin*.\n\nThat said, this online survey has no pretention to be a random sample, nor is there random assignment to treatment. This makes it unclear how much of an _additional_ problem missing data is. Nevertheless, here I walk the reader through where visitors attrit in the survey. \n\nVisitors can be lost in two different ways. The first is that they simply close the survey (whereafter the rest of the values are simply `NA`). The second happens when the visitor makes makes a choice that means their data will not be useful. Let's start with the latter class of cases.\n\n### Attrition via Respondent Choices\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nFirst, the visitor could click the `(Optional) - Do not use my data` button between assenting to the consent paragraph and cliking the Captcha. 34% of respondents do this.\n\n![](DEBUNKBOT-POST-IMAGES/DNUMD.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"75%\"}\n\nAll respondents' conspiracy theory descriptions are sent to ChatGPT to check that what the visitor described is, in fact, a conspiracy. If ChatGPT determines that the participant has *not* described a conspiracy, the participant sees the following page:\n\n![](DEBUNKBOT-POST-IMAGES/CONTINUE.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"75%\"}\n\nThose who click `Try other version` are shuttled into the `Disagree with experts` arm, but the majority choose `Continue`. The AI determined that, among those who wrote at least 30 characers describing a purported conspiracy theory, 44% of them failed to describe a conspiracy theory. Of those 44%, 67% chose to continue in the conspiracy arm anyway. The data from those in the latter group is not straightforwardly useful in analyses _about conspiracy theories_ since these people have not described a conspiracy. As a reminder, this failure to describe a conspiracy is prior to a failure to *believe* in the conspiracy. Which brings me to an interesting wrinkle.\n\nBelow, you see the scale the subjects used to indicate the extent to which they believe in their conspiracy theory. \n\n![](DEBUNKBOT-POST-IMAGES/CERTAINTY-SCALE.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"75%\"}\n\nWhat should we do if a person rates their conspiracy on the false side of uncertain? On the one hand, it might seem strange to talk about _belief_ in conspiracies among people who don't believe in conspiracies (where lack of belief in $p$ is defined as giving less than 50% probability to $p$). On the other hand, and I believe it's the more sophisticated hand, it makes just as much sense to say that an intervention reduced conspiracy belief from 40% to 20% as it does to talk about an 80% to 40% reduction. In both cases you reduced conspiracy belief by half, and there's nothing magical about the fact that the 80-to-40 reduction crosses 50. So, in all the analyses here, I allow for initial belief to be less than 50%.^[Much as the distinction in hypothesis testing between 'significant' and 'insignificant' is [not itself significant](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/signif4.pdf), the distinction between >50% credence and <50% credence is likewise not significant. Imagine you're working at a nuclear reactor where most people believe the probability it will \"go Chernobyl\" in the next month is 0.0000001%, but there are two weirdos who believe that probability is 45% and 55%, respectively. It would be extremely bizarre to group the 45% fella with the 0.0000001% group, but that's what treating 50% as a magical credence line does. In fact, *not* reifying 50% as a magical belief line seems especially relevant when talking about conspiracy belief. For example, imagine a person who gives \"only\" a 40% probability to the proposition that the earth is flat. Though they might not \"believe\" the earth is flat, they are wildly miscalibrated. If this all seems like pedantic necrotic horse over-flagellation, the Forecasting Research Institute released a [study](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/635693acf15a3e2a14a56a4a/t/66ba37a144f1d6095de467df/1723479995772/AIConditionalTrees.pdf) last year where they pitted a group **concerned** about AI safety against a group of  [superforecasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superforecaster) **unconcerned** about AI as an [X-risk](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/existential-risk). If we let $\\textbf A$ mean **AI causes existential catastrophe by year 2100**, the **concerned** group came into the study with $\\Pr(\\textbf A) = 28.4\\%$, while the **unconcerned** group came in at $\\Pr(\\textbf A) =0.5\\%$. If they had to binarized belief at 50%, the entire debate would have evaporated since no one would have 'believed' in the existential risk posed by AI. It would also result in strange descriptions of reality, such as \"There is a group of extremely concerned people dedicating their lives to reducing AI risk, even though they don't believe in it.\"]\n\n### Attrition via Exit\n\nNow, what about those who simply click out of the study?

My disagreement with experts was, \"I think that I think that the health benefits of ketogenic diets are more than just via reduction in calories consumed. Sugars, particularly simple sugars, might be uniquely bad for health (where weight is just one facet of overall health).\"^[And my elaboration was, \"I've known people who have lost a lot of weight on the keto diet, more so than any other diet. Also, I have a very vague but positive impression of Gary Taubes, a researcher associated with these ideas.\"] Now, I only gave this proposition a 55% chance of being true.^[In retrospect, 55% is pretty high. Were I to do it again I think I'd put it at 40%. I think I had some sort of glitch in my 'credence to number' mapping where I started (anchored) on 50% and then inched my probability upward to indicate that I thought the view has some merit. But a less dumb approach would have been to anchor on $\\Pr(\\text{non-obvious health claim is true)}$ and then increment *that* upward to the extent the keto claim is more likely than a random non-obvious health claim.] And though I gave the LLM a claim that is at least plausible and I expressed almost maximal uncertainty about it, the LLM seemed forced to argue against my claim as if I had given it a ludricrous claim and said I was certain (e.g. smoking doesn't actually cause lung cancer, 95%!). That is, neither the direction nor the degree to which user is miscalibrated is taken into account. It would make the behind-the-scenes design a bit more complicated, but ideally you would let the model change its argumentative tack based on the (lack of) discrepancy between the plausibility of the visitor's view (conspiracy, disagreement with experts) and the probability the user assigns to that view. In that case, instead of \"DebunkBot\" it would be more \"CalibrationBot\" that reasons with the user in such a way to get to that probability.^[The survey actually already calculates the plausibility of the claim, but as far as I can make out that information is only used to subset respondents' change scores to generate personalized feedback like, \"When compared to others who hold beliefs in *conspiracies with similar plausibility* and personal importance levels, your change in belief ranks at the 61st percentile. This means your level of belief change was greater than that of approximately 61% of similar respondents.\"]",
