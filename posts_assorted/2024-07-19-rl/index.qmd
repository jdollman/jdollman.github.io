Until I've finished working through the exercises in Barto and Sutton's [classic](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html), I won't try my hand at a fun RL application. For now I'll just point to a few certificates as indications of my increasing competence in reinforcement learning.

I've completed two DataCamp courses on Reinforcement Learning, [Reinforcement Learning in Gymnasium](../../certificates/rl_gym-certificate.pdf) [Deep Reinforcement Learning](../../certificates/drl-certificate.pdf), as well as Hugging Face's [DRL course](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction).
